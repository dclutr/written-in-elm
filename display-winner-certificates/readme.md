PROBLEM STATEMENT

  we have weeky online meetings as part of a Toastmaster Club ( checkout https://www.toastmasters.org/ )

  in the meeting, audience members have to vote for their favourite performers in different categories

  at the end of the meeting, a slideshow of certificates are shown to congratulate each of the winners
  
  but editing a ppt with certificates during the meeting can be tedious
   
  1. the date, time and meeting number need to be changed for the certificates of each winner
  
  2. sometimes changing the signature or club name is also desirable
  
  3. slides need to be deleted and added depending on number of winners

SOLUTION

just let the user type the information below and let the code handle making the slideshow of certificates
